# Orb Randomizer
This is a simple mod that randomizes the orb upgrade paths. There are currently two modes: LEVEL and LOOP.

### Level
Follows the normal upgrade pattern of 1 -> 2 -> 3. The orb itself is randomized.

### Loop
The next upgrade for any orb is completely random. This means you can go from 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3. There is a single upgrade path, meaning you can keep upgrading one orb until it becomes the original orb again.

## Config
There are several options available in the config to change your experience. You can randomize your starter deck, or maybe just the cruciball stone. All parts of the mod can be disable, so you can choose which parts you want!
