# Orb Randomizer
This is a simple mod that randomizes the orb upgrade paths. There are currently two modes: LEVEL and LOOP.

### Level
Follows the normal upgrade pattern of 1 -> 2 -> 3. Each level will be a different orb.

### Loop
The next upgrade for any orb is completely random. This includes both level and orb. The upgrades create a singlular closed loop, allowing the player to upgrade their orb all the way back to the original if they so choose.

## Config
There are several options available in the config to change your experience. You can randomize your starter deck, or maybe just the cruciball stone. All parts of the mod can be disable, so you can choose which parts you want!
